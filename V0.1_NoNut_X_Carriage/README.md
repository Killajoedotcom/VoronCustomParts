## Installation Notes
Insert the retainer into the carriage multiple times before attaching the belt.  This is to ensure there is a good fit. Use the removal tool to push out the retainer from the front. 

With the retainer positioned in front of the X extrusion, slide the belts into the retainer matching the teeth, and press the x-carriage on to the retainer. 

You can leave a little extra belt, if you want and bend it to the side.

Fasten with M3x8 screws, do not over tighten without nut.

Optional nut - superglue the nut onto the retainer.
